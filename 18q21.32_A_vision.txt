It is because I occupy
this spot and not those ribbed
beyond my blood-bounds, the bright lip

of my eyes and their admissions, 
giving and taking in curious elisions
of colored blur and carvature, a mind divides

touch from distance, strings and cinches
these with memory, crinkled ribbon
too short to stitch together what it's given.

It is to rescue stars out of the tide,
out of the squinted evening sifting,
I've waited to receive a vision,

i.e. be hijacked by another's sight, dipped
in inverted vistas where a sun robed purple
                         c

But blindly and daily to feel your eyes imbibe
my face, a matter of facts, a blip
smiled abruptly by among the hectic cycles

Look at me.  At this _ behind my sight
The thing that stays and stirs, the only thing
I will stay with you as long as you
as long as you extend
unto the end {of days, of fingers} clench


"Reader, sharpen your own eyes here to see
the truth, for now the veil is certainly
so fine that passing through it will be easy."   (Purg. 8.19-21)

"Because your mind is set
upon nothing but terrestrial things,
you gather darkness out of light itself"  (Purg. 15.64-66)

'could not bear to be veiled by anything' (Purg. 29.27)

'The lady scolded me: "Why are you so
intent on the living lights that you pay no
attention to what there is behind them?" (Purg. 29.61-63)
