It is because I occupy
this spot and not those ribbed
beyond my blood-bounds, the bright lip

of my eyes and their admissions, 
giving and taking in curious elisions
shadows blur and carvature, a mind divides

touch from distance, strings and cinches
these with memory, crinkled ribbon
too short to stitch together what it's given.

It is to rescue stars out of the tide,
out of the squinted evening sifting,
I've waited to receive a vision,

i.e. be hijacked by another's sight, dipped
in inverted vistas where a sun robed purple
beckons shadows to blare through the cracks.

But blindly and daily to feel your eyes imbibe
my face, a matter of fact, a blip
smiled abruptly by among the hectic cycles

to age and shrink among your thoughts hubbub
the only visions those which appear

--------------------

the only vision this which daily comes



it is only possible to see by being partial, trapped
as perspective, articulate as song's barbs.

we gain dimension by accumulating ghosts,
layering place on place
cross-criss, cicatrice

love requires this dexterity: to hold and to forget
leaving needs memory, staying forgetfulness

your face engraved
on the inside of my own, through which I see

I wake across our bed as into
my creased heart

Look.  At this _ behind my sight
The thing that stays and stirs, the only thing
I will stay with you as long as you
as long as you extend
unto the end {of days, of fingers} clench

we 2 caves beckoning each other inside out

A vision is a reduction of distances, a descent
from higher dimensions into what can be clenched

the accumulations of these graspings unfold the real, like peelings from oranges

The totality of possible views of a [] never changes,
each point the convergence of infinite radii
an asterisk where what converges vanishes and reappears.


'The glare will distress him, will he not think 
the shadows are truer?' 'Far truer.'
                        - Soc.  Glaucon

"The objective world is, it does not happen.  
Only to the gaze of my consciousness, 
crawling along the lifeline of my body, 
does a section of the world come to light 
as a fleeting image in space, 
which continually changes in time."  
                                      - Hermann Weyl

"Reader, sharpen your own eyes here to see
the truth, for now the veil is certainly
so fine that passing through it will be easy."   (Purg. 8.19-21)

"Because your mind is set
upon nothing but terrestrial things,
you gather darkness out of light itself"  (Purg. 15.64-66)

'could not bear to be veiled by anything' (Purg. 29.27)

'The lady scolded me: "Why are you so
intent on the living lights that you pay no
attention to what there is behind them?" (Purg. 29.61-63)
