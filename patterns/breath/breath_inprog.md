Teashirt homolog 3 (TSHZ3) Transcriptional regulator involved in
developmental processes. Functions in association with APBB1, SET and
HDAC factors as a transcriptional repressor, that inhibits the
expression of CASP4. TSHZ3-mediated transcription repression involves
the recruitment of histone deacetylases HDAC1 and HDAC2. Associates with
chromatin in a region surrounding the CASP4 transcriptional start
site(s) (PubMed:19343227). Regulates the development of neurons involved
in both respiratory rhythm and airflow control. Promotes maintenance of
nucleus ambiguus (nA) motoneurons, which govern upper airway function,
and establishes a respiratory rhythm generator (RRG) activity compatible
with survival at birth. Involved in the differentiation of the proximal
uretic smooth muscle cells during developmental processes. Involved in
the up-regulation of myocardin, that directs the expression of smooth
muscle cells in the proximal ureter (By similarity). Involved in the
modulation of glutamatergic synaptic transmission and long-term synaptic
potentiation (By similarity)

TSHZ3 haploinsufficiency due to proximal chromosome 19q13.11 deletions
causes a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by developmental
delay, absent or delayed speech, intellectual disability, and autistic
features. Some patients may have reanal tract abnormalities. Expressed
in brain; strongly reduced in post-mortem elderly subjects with
Alzheimer disease (PubMed:18776146, PubMed:19343227). Expressed in the
fetal neocortex (PubMed:27668656).
